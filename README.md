# Portfolio

## Description

Hi, I'm Marjan!
As a full stack developer student, I have built my portfolio website using HTML and CSS. My motivation for building this project was to showcase my skills and expertise as a developer. I wanted to create a platform that effectively communicates my experience and projects to potential clients or employers.

This project solves the problem of having a static resume that only lists my experience and skills. With my portfolio website, I can provide a more interactive and engaging experience for the viewer. They can see my projects, read about me, my experience, and even contact me through the site.

In building this website, I learned a lot about front-end development, including responsive design and CSS animations. Overall, building my portfolio website was a great learning experience that allowed me to showcase my skills and grow as a developer.
